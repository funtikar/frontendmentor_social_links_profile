### What I learned

These aren't new just doing some retention 

1. **Updated Font Import with Font Weights:**
   - `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');`
     - This line imports the "Inter" font from Google Fonts with specific font weights (400, 600, and 700).

2. **Setting Font Family:**
   - `body { font-family: "Inter"; }`
     - Specifies the "Inter" font family for the entire document.

3. **Custom Font Weights:**
   - `.normal-text { font-weight: 400; }`
   - `.semi-bold-text { font-weight: 600; }`
   - `.bold-text { font-weight: 700; }`
     - Defines custom font weights for different classes, allowing flexibility in styling text.

4. **Background Color:**
   - `body { background: hsl(0, 0%, 8%); }`
     - Sets the background color of the entire page to a dark color.

5. **Text Color and Decoration:**
   - `h2, p, a { color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); }`
     - Defines the text color for `h2`, `p`, and `a` elements.
   - `a { text-decoration: none; }`
     - Removes the default underline decoration for anchor (link) elements.

6. **Custom Styling for a Specific Element:**
   - `#kad { background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%); width: 20%; ... }`
     - Applies specific styling to an element with the ID `kad`, including background color, width, padding, margin, and border-radius.

7. **CSS Box Model Adjustments:**
   - `#kad { padding-top: 3rem; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px; ... }`
     - Adjusts the padding of the `#kad` element, allowing fine-tuning of spacing.

8. **Image Styling:**
   - `#kad img { width: 27%; border-radius: 50%; }`
     - Styles the image within the element with ID `kad`, setting width and border-radius.

9. **Text Color and Margins:**
   - `.card-location { color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%); margin-top: 0; }`
   - `.card-fullname { margin-bottom: 10px; }`
   - `.card-bio { margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; }`
     - Sets text color and adjusts margins for specific elements with different classes.

10. **Styling for Social Links:**
    - `.social-links a { display: block; ... }`
      - Styles social links with specific padding, margins, and background color, creating a block-like appearance.

These are some of the additional CSS concepts demonstrated in the updated code.
### Continued development

This same project will probably be forked and be remade using preprocessors in CSS and "refactored"

### Useful resources
- ChatGPT (No, not that in that sense that I generated the code from ChatGPT , its for learning nuanced things like is this how people usually do font importing? or is it this way. ) Basically for things that I can't google I will ask ChatGPT as a tutor
